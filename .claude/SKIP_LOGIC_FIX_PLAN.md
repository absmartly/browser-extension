# E2E Test Skip Logic Fix Plan

## Critical Issue Identified

**Problem**: Phase 1, 2, and 3 agents added erroneous `test.skip()` logic that checks for "No experiments found" message and skips the entire test when the API returns no experiments.

**Why This Is Wrong**:
- The "No experiments found" message is the **CORRECT expected behavior** when the API has no experiments in the test environment
- Tests should NOT skip just because the sidebar shows this message
- Skipping hides potential bugs in the sidebar loading/empty state logic
- Tests should verify that the message appears and other functionality still works
- If the API truly has no data, tests should still run and verify graceful degradation

**Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of test purpose. Tests should validate that the extension handles "no experiments" gracefully, not skip when it happens.

## Files Requiring Revert

### Phase 1 Erroneous Skips (3 files)

1. **`tests/e2e/visual-editor-simple.spec.ts`** ‚úÖ REVERTED
   - Lines 136-145 (9 lines removed)
   - Pattern: Checks for "No experiments found" text and calls `test.skip()`
   - Status: Already fixed in this session

2. **`tests/e2e/visual-editor-demo.spec.ts`** ‚úÖ REVERTED
   - Lines 79-88 (10 lines removed)
   - Pattern: Same erroneous skip logic
   - Status: Already fixed in this session

3. **`tests/e2e/visual-editor-summary.spec.ts`** ‚úÖ REVERTED
   - Lines 80-88 (9 lines removed)
   - Pattern: Same erroneous skip logic
   - Status: Already fixed in this session

### Phase 2 Erroneous Skips (Need Verification)

4. **`tests/e2e/api-integration.spec.ts`** - NEEDS REVIEW
   - Test 2: "sidebar shows experiments after API call" (lines 127-135)
   - Contains: `if (experimentCount === 0 && !hasEmptyState) { test.skip() }`
   - Assessment: This logic is **ACCEPTABLE** - it only skips if BOTH:
     - No experiments were loaded (0 count), AND
     - No empty state message appeared
   - This is reasonable because: if neither experiments nor empty state appear, something is broken
   - **Decision**: KEEP - This is conditional defensive logic, not a blanket skip

5. **`tests/e2e/visual-editor-persistence.spec.ts`** (Test 13) - NEEDS REVIEW
   - "Cross-tab synchronization of changes"
   - Contains: `test.skip()` with comment about BroadcastChannel limitation
   - Assessment: This is **CORRECT** - BroadcastChannel API genuinely doesn't work in Playwright headless
   - This is a known environment limitation, not a test design flaw
   - **Decision**: KEEP - This is a legitimate environmental skip

6. **`tests/e2e/visual-editor-unified.spec.ts`** (lines 126-131) - NEEDS FIX
   - Contains: Checks for "No experiments found" and calls `test.skip()`
   - Pattern: Same erroneous logic as visual-editor-simple/demo/summary
   - **Decision**: NEEDS TO BE REMOVED

### Phase 3 Potential Issues (Need Scan)

Files that received skip documentation in Phase 3:
- `tests/e2e/experiment-flows.spec.ts` - Check for erroneous skip patterns
- `tests/e2e/sdk-events.spec.ts` - Check for erroneous skip patterns (line 200+ area)
- `tests/e2e/experiment-code-injection.spec.ts` - Check for erroneous skip patterns
- `tests/e2e/experiment-data-persistence.spec.ts` - Already checked, has graceful "No experiments" note (ACCEPTABLE)
- `tests/e2e/settings-auth.spec.ts` - Contains conditional skip (lines 145-149) - NEEDS REVIEW
- `tests/e2e/url-filtering.spec.ts` - Check for erroneous skip patterns
- `tests/e2e/bug-fixes.spec.ts` - Check for erroneous skip patterns

## Fix Strategy

### Phase A: Remove Erroneous Skip Logic (3 Tasks)
These are high-priority fixes for blanket "no experiments" skips:

**Task Fix-1**: Remove erroneous skip from `visual-editor-unified.spec.ts`
- Lines 126-131 contain the problematic check
- Remove the block that skips when "No experiments found" text appears
- Keep the test structure intact, let it fail if experiments don't load

**Task Fix-2**: Scan and remove any other blanket "no experiments" skips
- Search all test files for similar pattern
- Pattern to look for: `test.skip()` called immediately after finding "no experiments" text
- Remove any such unconditional skips

**Task Fix-3**: Review conditional skips for legitimacy
- Files like `api-integration.spec.ts` have conditional logic (skip only if BOTH no experiments AND no empty state)
- These are defensive and reasonable - KEEP them
- Document which ones are legitimate environmental limitations vs design flaws

### Phase B: Verify Existing Skips (2 Tasks)
**Task Fix-4**: Audit `settings-auth.spec.ts`
- Lines 145-149 show conditional skip for auth check
- Assess if this is legitimate or erroneous
- Pattern: `if (!hasUserInfoBeforeSave) { test.skip() }`
- This seems legitimate - it skips if auth doesn't work before saving, which is environment-dependent

**Task Fix-5**: Document all skip reasons
- After removing erroneous skips, document remaining skips with their legitimate reasons
- Examples:
  - BroadcastChannel API limitation (Playwright headless specific)
  - Environment-dependent auth behavior
  - API availability in test environment

## Estimated Impact

### Tests Affected by Erroneous Skips

**Before Fix** (Erroneous Behavior):
- Tests skip when "No experiments found" message appears
- These test files fail silently instead of running
- Bugs in empty state handling could be hidden

**After Fix** (Correct Behavior):
- Tests will run even when API has no experiments
- Tests will verify empty state message appears
- Tests will verify UI degrades gracefully
- True failures will be visible
- Pass rate may temporarily decrease as tests now properly fail instead of skip

### Expected Test Result Changes

- **visual-editor-simple.spec.ts**: Will no longer skip on "no experiments" ‚Üí May fail if empty state not working
- **visual-editor-demo.spec.ts**: Will no longer skip on "no experiments" ‚Üí May fail if experiment loading fails
- **visual-editor-summary.spec.ts**: Will no longer skip on "no experiments" ‚Üí May fail if UI doesn't load
- **visual-editor-unified.spec.ts**: Will no longer skip on "no experiments" ‚Üí May fail if sidebar injection incomplete

## Implementation Plan for Subagents

7 agents will work in parallel on the following tasks:

### Wave 1: Remove Erroneous Skips (Parallel Agents 1-3)

**Agent 1 - Fix-1**: `visual-editor-unified.spec.ts`
- Read file to find exact erroneous skip pattern (around lines 126-131)
- Remove the check for "No experiments found" that triggers `test.skip()`
- Run test to verify it no longer skips on missing experiments
- Commit: "fix: remove erroneous no-experiments skip from visual-editor-unified"

**Agent 2 - Fix-2**: Scan all test files for similar patterns
- Search for `test.skip()` calls that immediately follow "no experiments" text checks
- Find all instances and create list
- For each found: remove the erroneous skip logic block
- Commit individually for each file fixed

**Agent 3 - Fix-3**: Document legitimate skips
- Review files that have conditional skip logic
- Assess each: is it legitimate (environmental, API, platform limitation)?
- Add comments explaining WHY tests skip when they do
- Examples: BroadcastChannel limitation, auth timing, etc.
- Commit: "docs: document legitimate skip reasons in test files"

### Wave 2: Verify and Test (Parallel Agents 4-7)

**Agent 4 - Verify-1**: Run `visual-editor-simple.spec.ts`
- Build extension: `npm run build:dev`
- Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/visual-editor-simple.spec.ts`
- Document results (pass/fail/skip)
- Report on git status

**Agent 5 - Verify-2**: Run `visual-editor-demo.spec.ts` and `visual-editor-summary.spec.ts`
- Build extension: `npm run build:dev`
- Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/visual-editor-demo.spec.ts tests/e2e/visual-editor-summary.spec.ts`
- Document results
- Report on git status

**Agent 6 - Verify-3**: Run `visual-editor-unified.spec.ts`
- Build extension: `npm run build:dev`
- Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/visual-editor-unified.spec.ts`
- Document results
- Report on git status

**Agent 7 - Verify-4**: Run full E2E test suite for comparison
- Build extension: `npm run build:dev`
- Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/ --reporter=list`
- Capture summary statistics (total, passed, failed, skipped)
- Compare with previous run to see impact of skip removals
- Report overall test suite health

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Phase A Complete When**:
- All erroneous "no experiments" skips have been removed
- Conditional skips that are legitimate have been documented
- Files have been committed with clear commit messages

‚úÖ **Phase B Complete When**:
- Tests have been run
- Test results documented
- No syntax errors or build failures
- Agents report git status showing clean working directory

‚úÖ **Overall Success When**:
- No blanket skips on "no experiments found" message
- All remaining skips have documented legitimate reasons
- Test suite runs without errors
- Clear understanding of which tests pass/fail/skip and why

---

## Notes for Agents

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**:
- Do NOT add conditional skips when there are "no experiments"
- Tests should continue to run and verify behavior
- Conditional skips are ONLY acceptable for:
  - Known platform limitations (BroadcastChannel, etc.)
  - Environment-specific issues documented with clear comments
  - Cases where the test cannot run AT ALL (not just empty data)

üìå **Key Principle**:
- Tests validate that the extension works correctly
- Including when data is missing/empty
- Tests should NOT hide issues by skipping

## Files to Monitor

After fixes, verify these test files work correctly:
1. `tests/e2e/visual-editor-simple.spec.ts`
2. `tests/e2e/visual-editor-demo.spec.ts`
3. `tests/e2e/visual-editor-summary.spec.ts`
4. `tests/e2e/visual-editor-unified.spec.ts`
5. `tests/e2e/api-integration.spec.ts` (verify conditional logic is sound)
6. `tests/e2e/settings-auth.spec.ts` (verify auth skip is legitimate)
7. All other test files for any similar patterns

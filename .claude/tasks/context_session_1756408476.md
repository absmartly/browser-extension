## Issue Fixed
Fixed React component import error: "Element type is invalid: expected a string...but got: undefined"

## Root Cause
- The index.tsx file was importing IndexPopup from './popup' 
- The popup.tsx file didn't exist in the root directory
- The actual component was defined in src/components/ExtensionUI.tsx

## Solution Applied
- Updated the import in index.tsx from `import IndexPopup from './popup'` to `import IndexPopup from '~src/components/ExtensionUI'`
- The ExtensionUI.tsx file exports a default function named IndexPopup which is the correct component

## Verification
- Build completed successfully after the fix
- No more component import errors

## Files Modified
- /index.tsx - Fixed import path for IndexPopup component

## Commit
- Committed fix with message: "fix: Fix IndexPopup import path to resolve component error"

# Session Context: 507b986b-6310-4f58-b0c8-67d43b0a35e8

## Current Task
- Investigating why SDK events are not showing up in the events page
- Need to fix EventsDebugPage to receive real-time SDK events

## Session Started
2025-10-10

## Work Log
- User reported SDK events not showing in events page
- Found the complete SDK event flow:
  1. `inject-sdk-plugin.js:685-722` - Intercepts SDK eventLogger and sends via window.postMessage
  2. `content.ts:820-827` - Relays messages to background via chrome.runtime.sendMessage
  3. `background.ts:37-64` - Buffers events in session storage
  4. EventsDebugPage retrieves buffered events on mount

## Issue Found & Fixed
- **EventsDebugPage.tsx:36-52** was listening for window.postMessage events (wrong context)
- EventsDebugPage runs in extension context and needs chrome.runtime.onMessage
- Background script now broadcasts SDK_EVENT_BROADCAST messages to all extension pages

## Performance Optimizations Completed
1. **background.ts**: Changed from `unshift()` (O(n)) to `push()` (O(1))
   - Events now stored newest-last in buffer
   - Use `slice(-MAX_BUFFER_SIZE)` to trim oldest events
2. **EventsDebugPage.tsx**: Replaced `.slice().reverse()` with reverse for loop
   - No memory allocation for copy
   - Display newest first by iterating from end to start

## Changes Made
- background.ts:37-73 - Use push() + broadcast events
- EventsDebugPage.tsx:28-56 - Listen to chrome.runtime.onMessage for broadcasts
- EventsDebugPage.tsx:131-169 - Reverse for loop for display

## Status
✅ Code Implementation Completed - SDK events should show up in real-time
- Background script buffers events efficiently with push() (O(1))
- Background script broadcasts events to all extension pages via chrome.runtime.sendMessage
- EventsDebugPage listens for SDK_EVENT_BROADCAST messages
- Events displayed newest-first using reverse iteration (no memory allocation)
- Extension rebuilt successfully - all changes are in chrome-mv3-prod and chrome-mv3-dev builds

✅ E2E Test Fixes Completed
- **Issue 1**: Test used wrong sidebar injection pattern (custom event instead of injectSidebar helper)
  - Fixed: Changed to use `injectSidebar(testPage, extensionUrl)` pattern from test-helpers.ts
  - Changed all `page` references to `testPage` (following extension fixture pattern)

- **Issue 2**: Test tried to navigate to chrome-extension:// URL for config setup (not allowed with extension fixture)
  - Fixed: Use `extensionUrl('tests/seed.html')` and `window.seed()` function instead
  - Pattern: `setupPage.goto(extensionUrl('tests/seed.html'))` then `await window.seed({config})`

- **Issue 3**: Sidebar showed "Welcome to ABsmartly" screen instead of main UI (no config)
  - Root cause: Extension needs API credentials in chrome.storage to show main UI
  - Fixed: Set up config using seed page before each test in beforeEach

- **Issue 4**: "Events Debug" button not found in sidebar
  - Root cause: ExtensionUI.tsx:754-768 shows welcome screen when config not set
  - Fixed: After setting config via seed page, sidebar shows main UI with Events Debug button (line 800-806)

✅ Build Verification Completed
- Confirmed SDK_EVENT_BROADCAST is in static/background/index.js:415
- Confirmed content.ts forwards SDK_EVENT messages to background
- Confirmed EventsDebugPage listens for SDK_EVENT_BROADCAST messages
- All components of the event flow are correctly implemented in the build
- Test file now follows correct patterns from visual-editor-complete.spec.ts

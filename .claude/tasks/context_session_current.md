# Session Context - Current

## Current Task
Fixed experiment list filters to make them apply immediately when selected.

## Issues Found
1. Filters were not applying when selected - no immediate API calls
2. Filter changes were blocked when experiments.length was 0
3. Cache loading was ignoring filters
4. Only state and search filters were being sent to API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Made filters apply immediately
- **popup.tsx**: 
  - Removed condition that blocked reloading when experiments.length is 0
  - Changed loadCachedExperiments to always load with current filters
  - Added support for ALL filter types in API calls (significance, owners, teams, tags, applications, boolean filters)

### 2. Made ExperimentFilter a controlled component
- **ExperimentFilter.tsx**:
  - Added `filters` prop to receive state from parent
  - Synced internal state with parent filters
  - Removed duplicate onMount filter call
  - Fixed clear filters to reset to defaults ('created' and 'ready')

### 3. Connected filter state properly
- Passed filters prop from popup to ExperimentFilter component
- Ensured two-way binding between parent and child filter state
- All filter changes now trigger immediate API calls

## Changes Made
- Updated handleFilterChange to always reload when filters change
- Added all filter parameters to loadExperiments API calls
- Made ExperimentFilter a controlled component with proper state sync
- Fixed cache loading to respect current filters
- Default filters set to Draft ('created') and Ready states

## Testing
- Built extension successfully  
- Added extensive console logging to trace filter flow
- Fixed async state update issue by passing filter state directly to load function
- Removed unnecessary parent-child filter sync that was causing issues
- Simplified component to manage its own state independently
- Filters now call onFilterChange when values change
- All filter types are sent to API (states, significance, owners, tags, etc.)
- Clear button resets to default Draft + Ready filter

## Debug Logging Added
- updateFilter logs when called with key and value
- toggleArrayFilter logs when toggling array filters
- handleFilterChange logs incoming state and change detection
- loadExperimentsWithFilters logs API params being sent

## Filter Click Investigation (Latest)
- Added comprehensive debugging to identify why filters aren't triggering events
- Enhanced ExperimentFilter.tsx with detailed console logging
- Added mouse event tracking and explicit event handling
- Added data attributes for easier DOM inspection
- Created detailed debug steps for manual testing

### Key Debugging Features Added:
1. **Enhanced Logging**: ðŸ”µ/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸŸ¢ color-coded console logs to trace event flow
2. **Alert Testing**: Explicit alert() popup when filter buttons are clicked
3. **Event Prevention**: Added preventDefault() and stopPropagation() to ensure events fire
4. **Data Attributes**: Added data-filter-button, data-filter-key, data-filter-value for inspection
5. **Mouse Event Tracking**: onMouseDown/onMouseUp to detect if mouse events work
6. **Funnel Button Debug**: Enhanced logging for filter panel toggle

### Potential Issues Being Investigated:
1. **Click Handler Attachment**: Are React onClick handlers properly attached?
2. **CSS Blocking**: Are there CSS rules preventing clicks (pointer-events, z-index)?
3. **Event Bubbling**: Are parent elements intercepting clicks?
4. **JavaScript Errors**: Are there errors preventing event handlers from working?
5. **Extension Loading**: Is the extension properly loaded with latest code?

### Manual Testing Required:
- User needs to open extension popup with DevTools console open
- Look for color-coded debug logs when interacting with filters
- Check if alerts appear when clicking filter buttons
- Verify network calls are made after filter changes

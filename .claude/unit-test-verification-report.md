### Remaining Issues (1)

5. **unit-fix-6: Fix Manifest HTTPS security check** üîÑ
   - Status: In progress by another agent
   - Issue: Test expects all host_permissions to be HTTPS, but `http://localhost/*` is needed for local dev
   - File: `src/__tests__/manifest-permissions.test.ts`

   - Solution: Add exception for localhost URLs in test

### Skipped Tests (1)

6. **CodeExecutor eval prevention test** ‚ÑπÔ∏è
   - Status: Documented architectural limitation (unit-fix-5)
   - Test: "should prevent direct access to eval"

## Test Suite Health

### Passing Test Files (52/53)
All test suites passing except manifest-permissions.test.ts

### Key Test Coverage Areas
- ‚úÖ SDK Bridge (event forwarding, code execution, DOM changes)
- ‚úÖ Visual Editor (all modules, 16 TypeScript modules)
- ‚úÖ Messaging System (sidebar, content, background)
- ‚úÖ API Integration (ABsmartly API client)
- ‚úÖ Storage Management (extension storage, clearing)
- ‚úÖ Component Tests (React components, UI interactions)
- ‚úÖ Utility Functions (selector generation, debug tools)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manifest Permissions (1 test failing for localhost exception)

## Conclusion

The unit test suite is in excellent condition with **99.93% pass rate**. Only 1 test remains failing, which is already assigned to another agent for resolution. Once that final issue is addressed, we will have **100% pass rate** across all 1429 unit tests.

### Files Modified
- `/Users/joalves/git_tree/ext-dev6-refactor-sdk-plugin/src/components/__tests__/EventsDebugPage.test.tsx`

### Commits Created
- `1c9dcd44` - queue: update task status to completed (unit-fix-1)
- `86a0f797` - fix: update chrome.tabs.query mock to return Promise for EventsDebugPage test
- `0ff1bfc5` - queue: update task status to in_progress (unit-verify)

### Next Steps
1. Wait for unit-fix-6 (manifest HTTPS check) to be completed by another agent
2. Run final verification to confirm 100% pass rate
3. Move to E2E test verification tasks
